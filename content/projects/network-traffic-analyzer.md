# Network Traffic Analyzer

A comprehensive Python tool for analyzing network traffic patterns and detecting potential security threats in real-time.

## Overview

This project started when I needed a lightweight alternative to Wireshark for automated traffic analysis. The tool captures packets, analyzes protocols, and alerts on suspicious activities.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time packet capture** using Scapy
- **Protocol analysis** (TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS)
- **Suspicious pattern detection**
- **Automated alerting system**
- **Export capabilities** (CSV, JSON, PCAP)

### Security Detection Rules
- Port scanning detection
- DNS tunneling identification
- Unusual traffic volumes
- Known malicious IP addresses
- Protocol anomalies

## Technical Implementation

```

## Key Code Components

### Packet Capture Engine
```python
from scapy.all import sniff, IP, TCP, UDP

class PacketAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, interface='eth0'):
        self.interface = interface
        self.packet_count = 0
        
    def analyze_packet(self, packet):
        if IP in packet:
            src_ip = packet[IP].src
            dst_ip = packet[IP].dst
            
            # Protocol-specific analysis
            if TCP in packet:
                self.analyze_tcp(packet)
            elif UDP in packet:
                self.analyze_udp(packet)
                
    def start_capture(self):
        sniff(iface=self.interface, 
              prn=self.analyze_packet, 
              store=0)
```

### Detection Rules
```python
class ThreatDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.port_scan_threshold = 10
        self.connection_attempts = {}
        
    def detect_port_scan(self, src_ip, dst_port):
        if src_ip not in self.connection_attempts:
            self.connection_attempts[src_ip] = set()
            
        self.connection_attempts[src_ip].add(dst_port)
        
        if len(self.connection_attempts[src_ip]) > self.port_scan_threshold:
            return self.generate_alert("PORT_SCAN", src_ip)
```

## Detection Capabilities

### 1. Port Scanning Detection
Identifies hosts attempting to connect to multiple ports:
- Tracks connection attempts per source IP
- Configurable threshold settings
- Time-based analysis windows

### 2. DNS Tunneling Detection
Monitors for suspicious DNS queries:
- Unusually long domain names
- High frequency of DNS requests
- Non-standard DNS record types

### 3. Traffic Volume Analysis
Detects bandwidth anomalies:
- Baseline traffic establishment
- Deviation detection algorithms
- Protocol-specific thresholds

## Usage Examples

### Basic Network Monitoring
```bash
# Start monitoring default interface
python network_analyzer.py --interface eth0 --mode monitor

# Enable specific detection rules
python network_analyzer.py --detect port-scan,dns-tunnel

# Export analysis results
python network_analyzer.py --export-format json --output results.json
```

### Advanced Analysis
```bash
# Analyze existing PCAP file
python network_analyzer.py --input traffic.pcap --analyze

# Generate detailed reports
python network_analyzer.py --report --timeframe 24h
```

## Results and Findings

### Performance Metrics
- **Packet Processing Rate**: ~50,000 packets/second
- **Memory Usage**: ~200MB baseline
- **CPU Usage**: 15-25% on single core
- **False Positive Rate**: <2% after tuning

### Real-World Testing
During a 30-day deployment on our office network:
- Detected 12 legitimate port scans
- Identified 3 potential DNS tunneling attempts
- Flagged 45 policy violations (P2P traffic)
- Zero false positives for critical alerts

## Security Considerations

### Deployment Best Practices
- Run with minimal privileges
- Encrypt stored packet data
- Implement access controls
- Regular rule updates

### Privacy Compliance
- Packet content anonymization
- Configurable data retention
- GDPR-compliant logging

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Machine Learning Integration** for anomaly detection
- **Distributed Analysis** across multiple sensors
- **Integration APIs** for SIEM platforms
- **Mobile Dashboard** for remote monitoring

### Performance Improvements
- Multi-threaded packet processing
- GPU acceleration for pattern matching
- Real-time database optimization

## Installation and Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/username/network-traffic-analyzer.git
cd network-traffic-analyzer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure detection rules
cp config/rules.example.yaml config/rules.yaml
nano config/rules.yaml

# Start monitoring
sudo python analyzer.py --config config/default.conf
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Performance vs. Accuracy**: Finding the right balance between deep packet inspection and real-time processing
2. **Rule Tuning**: Generic detection rules generate too many false positives
3. **Storage Strategy**: Raw packet storage becomes expensive quickly
4. **User Interface**: Security teams need actionable alerts, not just raw data

## Technical Challenges

### Packet Loss Prevention
High-speed networks can overwhelm the capture engine:
```python
# Buffer management solution
def manage_buffer(self, max_buffer_size=10000):
    if len(self.packet_buffer) > max_buffer_size:
        # Process oldest packets first
        self.process_batch(self.packet_buffer[:1000])
        self.packet_buffer = self.packet_buffer[1000:]
```

### False Positive Reduction
Implemented whitelist and learning modes:
```python
def is_whitelisted(self, src_ip, activity_type):
    return (src_ip in self.whitelist and 
            activity_type in self.whitelist[src_ip])
```

## Impact and ROI

- **Threat Detection**: 40% improvement in threat detection speed
- **Cost Savings**: $50k/year vs. commercial solutions
- **Team Efficiency**: 60% reduction in manual traffic analysis
- **Compliance**: Automated security monitoring reports

*This project taught me that effective security tools aren't just about detection - they're about providing actionable intelligence that security teams can actually use.*
