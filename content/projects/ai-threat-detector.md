# AI Threat Detector

An intelligent threat detection system that uses machine learning to identify suspicious network activities and potential security breaches through behavioral pattern analysis.

## Project Overview

Traditional signature-based detection systems often miss sophisticated attacks that don't match known patterns. This AI-powered system learns from normal network behavior and identifies anomalies that could indicate security threats.

## Architecture

### Data Pipeline
```python
# Data flow architecture
Raw Network Traffic → Feature Extraction → ML Model → Threat Classification → Alert System
```

### Core Components
- **Traffic Collector**: Captures and preprocesses network packets
- **Feature Engineer**: Extracts meaningful features from raw traffic
- **ML Pipeline**: Multiple models for different threat types
- **Alert System**: Real-time notifications and response actions

## Machine Learning Approach

### Feature Engineering
```python
def extract_features(packet_data):
    features = {
        'packet_size': len(packet_data),
        'time_delta': calculate_time_delta(packet_data),
        'port_ratio': unusual_port_ratio(packet_data),
        'payload_entropy': calculate_entropy(packet_data.payload),
        'protocol_distribution': get_protocol_stats(packet_data),
        'connection_frequency': get_connection_patterns(packet_data)
    }
    return features
```

### Model Selection
- **Isolation Forest**: For anomaly detection in network flows
- **LSTM Networks**: For sequence-based pattern recognition
- **Random Forest**: For multi-class threat classification
- **Autoencoder**: For unsupervised anomaly detection

### Training Process
```python
# Multi-stage training approach
1. Normal traffic baseline (unsupervised)
2. Known attack patterns (supervised)
3. Continuous learning from new threats
4. Model validation and deployment
```

## Key Features

### Real-time Analysis
- Processes 10,000+ packets per second
- Sub-100ms detection latency
- Minimal false positive rate (<2%)

### Threat Categories
- **DDoS Attacks**: Volumetric and application-layer attacks
- **Port Scanning**: Reconnaissance activity detection
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unusual outbound traffic patterns
- **Malware Communication**: C&C server identification
- **Insider Threats**: Abnormal user behavior patterns

### Adaptive Learning
```python
class AdaptiveThreatDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_model = load_pretrained_model()
        self.adaptation_layer = OnlineLearningLayer()
    
    def predict_and_learn(self, traffic_sample):
        prediction = self.base_model.predict(traffic_sample)
        confidence = self.calculate_confidence(prediction)
        
        if confidence > 0.95:
            # High confidence, use for online learning
            self.adaptation_layer.update(traffic_sample, prediction)
        
        return prediction, confidence
```

## Implementation Details

### Data Collection
```python
# Network traffic capture using Scapy
from scapy.all import sniff, IP, TCP, UDP

def packet_handler(packet):
    if IP in packet:
        features = extract_features(packet)
        threat_score = model.predict([features])
        
        if threat_score > THRESHOLD:
            alert_system.trigger_alert(packet, threat_score)
```

### Feature Store
```python
# Real-time feature computation
class FeatureStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.window_size = 1000  # packets
        self.feature_cache = {}
    
    def compute_features(self, packet):
        # Statistical features over time windows
        # Protocol distribution analysis
        # Behavioral pattern detection
        return feature_vector
```

### Model Deployment
```yaml
# Docker deployment configuration
version: '3.8'
services:
  ai-threat-detector:
    image: threat-detector:latest
    environment:
      - MODEL_PATH=/models/threat_detector_v2.pkl
      - THRESHOLD=0.85
      - ALERT_ENDPOINT=http://siem:8080/alerts
    volumes:
      - ./models:/models
      - ./logs:/logs
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Class Imbalance
**Problem**: Normal traffic vastly outnumbers attacks
**Solution**: 
```python
# Synthetic minority oversampling
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_balanced, y_balanced = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```

### Concept Drift
**Problem**: Attack patterns evolve over time
**Solution**:
```python
# Continuous model retraining
def detect_concept_drift(new_data, reference_data):
    drift_score = statistical_distance(new_data, reference_data)
    return drift_score > DRIFT_THRESHOLD

if detect_concept_drift(recent_traffic, baseline_traffic):
    trigger_model_retraining()
```

### Real-time Requirements
**Problem**: High-speed processing requirements
**Solution**:
```python
# Optimized prediction pipeline
@lru_cache(maxsize=10000)
def cached_feature_extraction(packet_hash):
    return extract_features(packet_hash)

# Batch processing for efficiency
def process_packet_batch(packets):
    features = [extract_features(p) for p in packets]
    predictions = model.predict_batch(features)
    return predictions
```

## Integration and Deployment

### SIEM Integration
```python
# Integration with security information and event management
class SIEMConnector:
    def send_alert(self, threat_data):
        alert = {
            'timestamp': threat_data['timestamp'],
            'threat_type': threat_data['classification'],
            'confidence': threat_data['confidence'],
            'source_ip': threat_data['source'],
            'severity': self.calculate_severity(threat_data)
        }
        self.siem_api.post('/alerts', alert)
```
